//       "At MOO I was part of a small team that got tasked to build a new application focussed on professional and hobbyist designers to enable them to create astonishing print products. In its essence this was an upload experience that guided customers through the process of putting their custom design on a card and get a high quality product shipped right to their door step. I worked in an agile team focussed both on frontend and backend. A test driven first methodology and good CI/CD practices allowed us to ship new features to our customers on a daily basis. I was also involved in a wider initiative to help create a shared design, style and component library. I kicked of the tires for a new react component library that helped teams deliver new UI features faster and reduce duplication across the company.",
