In its essence this was an upload experience that guided customers through the process of putting their custom design on a card and get a high quality product shipped right to their door step. I worked in an agile team focussed both on frontend and backend. A test driven first methodology and good CI/CD practices allowed us to ship new features to our customers on a daily basis. I was also involved in a wider initiative to help create a shared design, style and component library. I kicked of the tires for a new react component library that helped teams deliver new UI features faster and reduce duplication across the company. With the HR department I helped to ensure our recruitment campaigns were inviting to a diverse range of applicants.",
